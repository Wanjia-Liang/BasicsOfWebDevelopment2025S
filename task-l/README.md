Summary of Implemented Improvements

Add current page indicators and make the current page non-clickable to improve page orientation and usability (using aria-current="page" to enhance web accessibility).

Standardise product images by applying a consistent visual style with white backgrounds, giving the catalogue a more professional, car-store-like appearance.

Change all image aspect ratios from 16:9 to 5:3 to achieve improved visual balance and clearer presentation.

Correct minor HTML issues identified by the W3C HTML Validator that do not affect page rendering, in order to improve code quality and standards compliance.

Modify the styling of disabled selections by replacing the default grey appearance with a blue, bold style to enhance visibility and clarity.

Use CSS properties and @media queries to ensure responsive presentations across different screen sizes.

Refine the CSS for the header and footer to ensure a consistent appearance and layout across all pages.
